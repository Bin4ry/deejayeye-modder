APK Creation Using Windows

Grab the files from bin4ry. https://github.com/Bin4ry/deejayeye-modder

Unzip them to a folder. Create a tools folder. Create a PutPatchesHere folder.

Get this: https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/gnuwin32/patch/2.5.9-7/patch-2.5.9-7-setup.exe and install it. 
Go to the installed windows directory and copy patch.exe to the tools folder

Go get this and put it in the tools folder too: https://github.com/eleme/bspatch/blob/master/tools/windows/bspatch.exe

Next get this: https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads/ and download apktool_2.2.3.jar and put it in the tools folder. 
Rename it to apktool.jar

This one too: https://github.com/appium/sign/raw/master/dist/sign.jar Yup, goes in the tools folder

Now, you should have the following files in your tools folder: Apktool.jar, bspatch.exe, patch.exe and sign.jar

Go get the 4.1.3 APK from here: https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/dji-technology-co-ltd/dji-go-4/dji-go-4-4-1-3-release/dji-go-4-4-1-3-android-apk-download/ 
Put it in the PutApkHere folder. Rename this apk to orig.apk. Do you see how easy bin4ry made this for you? You need to tell him thanks. 
Ok, next. Go to the patches folder and copy the patches you want for the new APK. Paste them into the PutPatchesHere folder. 
Wow, that was easy. Almost ready to rock n roll.

Run RunMe.bat as admin. If you donâ€™t know how to do this, just stop right now. Follow the prompts, you can now choose what patches you want to apply!! 
Pick a number for the corresponding patch and hit enter to move to the next choice. Once you are done, enter P, then enter again. 
It may take a while, so be patient.
